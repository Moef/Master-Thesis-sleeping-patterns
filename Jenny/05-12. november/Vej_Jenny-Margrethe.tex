I here have my data from the last week - just to show my experiences. Usually the days are quite accurate, but I can definitely see something funny also... :) Oh, and yes - I am horrible at prioritising my sleep! I will try to be as honest as possible in the caption, where I shortly describes what you see. :) I have noted my self, that I am under influence of my exams (even though they are done, I have so much anxiety during exams they affects me for several weeks after) - and also I am pretty affected by the fact, I just got into a new relationship, which is of course a positive effect on my mind, but doubtless it is affecting my sleeping pattern.

\caption{Actually this is the same ``night'' - I was celebrating the end of my exam Thursday night, and got to bet around 01:44 in the night before Friday. Between 07:07 and 08:07 Friday morning something happened - and my watch decided not to measure anything	. If I check the webpage instead of the phone, the hour is just marked with diagonally gray stripes.}

\caption{Friday night I was working at our student bar - and then I needed to get up and help my boyfriend move to his new apartment. While him and his dad was picking up the trailer, I fell asleep at the couch - so everything looks right here, except from the unknown ~4 minutes on the first one. The app says it can be because the watch is placed wrongly or I was sleeping weird... }

Apparently I am working pretty still, because the watch thought I was asleep. This is the second time, I have falls positives, and this time two in a day. }
