NOTES 
1: I'm a bit afraid about the location details. I think WiFi is okay to check on, and I would like to have that part from Social Fabric also. But in general to see, where they are (location from the pseudocode on poster), I'm afraid people won't allow it. 

2: What data will I collect from my participants phones?



SOCIAL FABRIC - BASED ON EMAIL SENT A MONTH AGO: 

— I would like access to 30-50 students data 

—I would like access to questionnaires with these students (if limited access, I would like access to the parts where there is something about sleep). This is because, I would like to see what the participants are asked, and what the responses are. I have created some questionnaires before, but nothing like this, and nothing on this level - It would help my project and my own experiment to see, what works and one way to do it. Also I believe the questionnaires is highly important to get an understanding on what the data collected with the phones means. Besides that, I think it could be interesting to see if the different personality traits and working habits influence their sleep - and something that I might need to have in mind when creating my application (maybe different interventions is needed for different type of students)

— They mention in their article, that they have collected data from questionnaires, Facebook, mobile sensing, anthropological field study and the WiFi system om campus. My believes is, that the questionnaires, mobile sensing and maybe the anthropological field study is important to me. My thoughts about the questionnaires is already listed above.

- I don’t believe Facebook data is relevant to me. Also - I need to limit my project scope at some point.

— The data from this is primarily focused on the social part - my studies is on the sleeping part, so I have to be able to distinguish in the data, I hopefully can get access to.
