### June 24, 2015
* Kate is in Stanford from July 1 to August 31
* Weekly skypemeetings in Agust
* Work with Kimie Ryager who is also writing about sleeping patterns 
  (Jenny: Take contact to Kimie in July)
* Use already existing materials to collect data (Android stuff), and 
  build our own way to analyse it and our own "intervention-app"
* I need to "live" the project. Integrate it in my life. Try start 
  using Twitter and maybe write a blog
* Kate is using Mendeley for articles and SurveyMonkey for questionnaires
  (Jenny: Create user)
* I use Git for version control for code and wiki's like this one 
  (Jenny: Invite Kate to a repo)
* Kate is in contact with one of the authors of the data-collection in
  http://socialfabric.ku.dk/, and will investigate who we need to talk 
	to. She also knows have a lot of other materials/contacts she will send to 
	both me and Kimie


* "Titles"/what are we doing:
  - Smartphone perspective on sleeping patterns
  - Investigate factors affecting sleeping
  - How my smartphone sees my sleep


* Level of Ambition: 
  - Both Kate and Jenny have high ambitions
  - Jenny thinks it is possible to have extra high expectations because 
	  the thesis is (officially) from September 1, 2015 to July 15, 2016. 
		Even though Jenny is having courses along the thesis (in block 1, 
		2 and 4), the extra time allows us to conduct experiments if we feel 
		like it, and also to test out interventions etcetera. Also, we are 
		already beginning to start the initial footwork, so actually we will 
		work on this for almost a year
  - Jenny dreams of an PhD, and would be insanely proud to be able to 
	  publish articles about this work (and of course getting a PhD!!)
